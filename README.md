# bushfire

To do list:
- run random forests, logistic regression, .. on the new samples separately for div and fire danger rating
- remake the predictor density plots for div
- transformations to symmetrise
- plots of predictors (pairwise densities)
- read papers using splines, RF check description/explanation 
- Alex's comment on ratio? When ffdi in certain band look at proportion of fires. 

- International Journal of Wildland Fire (http://www.publish.csiro.au/?nid=114&issue=6993)
- more sophisticated method than previous analyses, fire journals
- unique: minimax sampling for time/space
- restructure paper into abstract, intro, methods (data, models), results, discussion

Extra distractions:
- matching days on FFDI or inputs (potentially part of error analysis)
    For each fire find the closest day (same location) with similar observations for FFDI/inputs
    Look up other variables and see their values, can we see a difference?

Completed:
- add fire danger rating to data
